## Who We Are

Hi! We're For Zero, a group of students (Siddhant Kameswar, Ruhan Gupta, and Omkar Patil) who make applications that transform student life. Our applications are completely free (or, for zero dollars), ad-free, and effective. Our goal is to make life easier for students by supplying important tools that can be used at home or in the classroom.

## Our Applications

We've started our journey with Vocabustudy, a free and simple way to study, learn, and memorize information. Check it out [here!](https://vocabustudy.org/)
